Ph.D. candidate at Yonsei University and member of [Building Informatics Group(BIG)](http://big.yonsei.ac.kr)(supervisor: Dr. Ghang Lee)
Proactive researcher with a focus on BIM case-based knowledge management, BIM adoption and collaboration in construction industry. Actively presented papers at academic conferences including introduction Korea BIM adoption and implementation. Prior to entering Ph.D. programe, worked as a researcher in the Department of Policy on Super high-rise building regulations at the [Korea Research Institute for Construction Policy(RICON)](http://www.ricon.re.kr/en/main.php) for three years. Main duties involved researching how to improve the approvals system and performance-based system for super high-rise building regulations.
